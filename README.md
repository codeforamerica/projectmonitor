[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/projectmonitor.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/projectmonitor)

Description
===========

ProjectMonitor is a CI display aggregator. It displays the status of multiple
Continuous Integration builds on a single web page.  The intent is that you
display the page on a big screen monitor or TV so that the status of all your
projects' builds are highly visible/glanceable (a "Big Visible Chart").
ProjectMonitor currently supports:

  * [Cruise Control](http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/)
  * [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)
  * [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
  * [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/)
  * [tddium](http://www.tddium.com/)
  * [Semaphore](http://www.semaphoreapp.com/)
  * [CircleCI](http://circleci.com)

This project is forked from [pivotal/projectmonitor](https://github.com/pivotal/projectmonitor). CfA uses it to show the status of fellowship projects and internal tools.

## Installation

### Get the code
ProjectMonitor is a Rails application. To get the code, execute the following:

    git clone git://github.com/pivotal/projectmonitor.git
    cd projectmonitor
    bundle install

### Initial Setup
We have provided an example file for `database.yml`. Run the following to 
automatically generate these files for you:

    rake setup

You likely need to edit the generated files.  See below.

### Set up the database
You'll need a database. Create it with whatever name you want.  If you have not
run `rake setup`, copy `database.yml.example` to `database.yml`.  Edit the
production environment configuration so it's right for your database:

    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
    <edit database.yml>
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate

### Set up memcached for performant/distributed caching
Statuses are cached via an in-memory store by default.  If you want to use memcache,
you'll need to ensure it's installed. It should be very easy to install if you have
homebrew or another package manager:

    brew install memcached

After you have successfully installed memcached follow the instructions to run it.

### Set up Vagrant
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) automatically sets up virtual machines to run 
Jenkins. First install VirtualBox. Then run the following commands to set it up.

    vagrant up

Useful commands

    vagrant ssh
    vagrant halt
    vagrant provision
    vagrant destroy #If you just halt, it will not rebuild everything from scratch

Once the VM has started, services will be available at `192.168.33.10`.

### Authentication support
#### IP Whitelist
If you want to use Webhooks, your ProjectMonitor instance will need to be located on a
publically accessible server. If you don't want your ProjectMonitor dashboard to also be
publically accessible, you can whitelist access by IP address.

The whitelist is disabled by default, but can be enabled by uncommenting the "ip_whitelist" property
in settings.yml and adding a list of IP addresses to whitelist. If you're running ProjectMonitor
behind a load balancer (e.g. on a hosted provider such as Heroku), you'll probably want to set
"ip_whitelist_request_proxied" to true. See settings.yml for more documentation.

#### Password authentication
Project monitor uses [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to provide both database backed authentication and
Google OAuth2 logins.

Regular password authentication for managing project settings is enabled by default and can be switched off
by setting the `password_auth_enabled` setting to `false`. To ensure strong
password encryption you should adjust the value for `password_auth_pepper` and
`password_auth_stretches` appropriately.

#### Google OAuth2 setup
To use Google OAuth2 authentication you need Google apps set up for your domain
and the following configuration options specified:

    oauth2_enabled: true
    oauth2_apphost: 'MY_APP_ID'
    oauth2_secret: 'MY_SECRET'

### Setup Cron with Whenever
We have included a sample whenever gem config in config/schedule.rb. Refer to
the [whenever documentation](https://github.com/javan/whenever) for instructions
on how to integrate it with your deployment. Refer to [Heroku scheduler documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) for instructions
on how to integrate the rake task with your Heroku deployment.

The default schedule clears log entries and fetches project statuses every 3 minutes.

The fetch project task is what goes out and hits the individual builds. We find
that if you do this too frequently it can swamp the builds. On the other hand,
you don't want ProjectMonitor displaying stale information. At Pivotal we set
it up to run every 3 minutes.

### Start workers
The cron job above will add jobs to the queue, which workers will execute.  To
start running the workers, use the following command:

    rake start_workers

The default number of workers is 2, but if you wanted 3 you would call it like this:

    rake start_workers[3]

These workers need only be started once per system reboot, and must be running
for your project statuses to update.  To stop the workers, run this command:

    rake stop_workers

The workers are implemented using the [delayed_job
gem](http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job).  The workers are configured
to have a maximum timeout of 1 minute when polling project status.  If you want
to change this setting, you can edit `config/initializers/delayed_job_config.rb`

### Start the application
Execute:

    nohup rails server -e production &> projectmonitor.log

## Configuration
Each build that you want ProjectMonitor to display is called a "project" in
ProjectMonitor. You can log in to set up projects by clicking the "Manage Projects" 
link in the bottom-right corner of the main ProjectMonitor screen. You can either
create a user using the console as follows:

    rails c production
    User.create!(login: 'john', name: 'John Doe', email: 'jdoe@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')

Or, if you have set up Google OAuth2 as per above, you can simply log in with Google to create a new user account.

### Add projects
After logging in, click the "New Project" button and enter
the details for a build you want to display on ProjectMonitor. The "Name" and
"Project Type" are required. You will need to either connect your service via
Webhooks or polling.

To connect via Webhooks, the project settings page will display the Webhook URL
you'll need to enter in your CI instance's settings. The Webhook URL isn't generated
until after a project is created, so you'll need to select the 'Webhooks' radio button,
click 'Create', and then click the 'Edit' button for the newly-created project
to get the Webhook URL.

In order for Webhooks to work, you'll also need to make sure that the machine hosting
ProjectMonitor is accessible by the machine hosting your CI instance.

If you want to set up a project to connect via polling instead, you'll typically need
to enter the base URL, build name or ID, and your login credentials with the CI service.

#### TeamCity
For TeamCity projects, find the buildTypeId (usually something like 'bt2') from the URL, which should look like one of the following: 

    http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=running:all,buildType:
    http://teamcity:8111/viewType.html?buildTypeId=
    http://teamcity:8111/viewLog.html?buildId=1&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=

You will also need a valid user account and password.

If you want TeamCity to connect via Webhooks, you'll need to install the
[TcWebHooks plugin](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/tcplugins/wiki/TcWebHooks) on 
your TeamCity instance. When setting up the webhook in TeamCity, make sure the payload 
format is set to "JSON" (it might show up as "JSON (beta)").

If you want to connect to TeamCity via polling, you will need to ensure that your TeamCity instance
is accessible by the machine running ProjectMonitor.

#### Semaphore
When configuring [Semaphore](http://semaphoreapp.com), you should use the Branch History URL from the API section of your Project Settings page.

This ensures that no build statuses will be missed. 

If you notice that there are build statuses missing in project monitor, ensure that you are NOT using the Branches URL from the API section (vs. the 
recommended Branch History URL).  The Branches URL from the API section returns only the latest build status, instead of the history, so if builds occurred 
between status fetches, they would be missed and not be reflected in project monitor.

#### Jenkins
If you want Jenkins to connect via Webhooks, you will need the
[Jenkins notification plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin).

If you want to connect to Jenkins via polling, you'll need to ensure that your Jenkins instance is accessible by the machine running ProjectMonitor.

#### Travis
If you want Travis to connect via Webhooks, you will still need to enter the 
GitHub account, repository, and optionally branch name for the codebase being
built in Travis.

#### TDDium
TDDium only supports connecting via polling, not Webhooks.

In order to get polling configured, you will need to log in to your TDDium dashboard, go to Organizations using the drop down in the top right corner.
Then click on organization settings for the appropriate organization. Then click on "Chat Notifications"; CCmenu is at the bottom of the page.
That should take you to a URL that looks like:

    https://api.tddium.com/cc/SOME-TOKEN-HERE/cctray.xml

The value for "SOME-TOKEN-HERE" is the TDDium authentication token you'll need to paste into the ProjectMonitor settings.
The XML returned by that link will look something like:

    <Projects>
       <Project name="foobar (master)" webUrl="https://api.tddium.com/1/reports/151751" lastBuildLabel="151751" 
       lastBuildTime="2013-01-08 18:20:05" lastBuildStatus="Failure" activity="Building"/>
    </Projects>

The "TDDium Project Name" field in the ProjectManager settings will need to be set to the full value of the Project
name attribute, complete with the branch name in parentheses (in this case, "foobar (master)"). 


### Importing and Exporting Configurations
You can export your configuration for posterity or to be transferred to another
host:

    rake projectmonitor:export > ${your_configuration.yml}

Or using heroku:

    heroku run rake projectmonitor:export --app projectmonitor-staging > ${your_configuration.yml}

Or you can download it using the configuration endpoint, using curl (or your web browser):

    curl --user ${username}:${password} ${your_project_monitor_host}/configuration > ${your_configuration.yml}

NOTE: That heroku doesn't treat STDERR and STDOUT differently so you may get
some warnings at the beginning of the generated file that you'll have to remove
manually.

It can be imported in a similar way:

    rake projectmonitor:import < ${your_configuration.yml}

On heroku or another host which doesn't allow you to directly load files or
read from stdin, you'll need to post the file to the configuration endpoint
like so:

    curl --user ${username}:${password} -F "content=@-" ${your_project_monitor_host}/configuration < ${your_configuration.yml}

## Upgrading
ProjectMonitor has recently moved to
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/) for authentication. This
means that any existing users will have invalid passwords. If you don't want
all your users to have to reset their passwords, you can alter the following
configuration settings to support legacy passwords:

    devise_encryptor: :legacy
    devise_pepper: <rest_auth_site_key>
    devise_stretches: <rest_auth_digest_stretches>

The values for `rest_auth_site_key` and `rest_auth_digest_stretches` can be found
in your `config/auth.yml`. This file is no longer needed.

## Deployment

### Heroku
To get running on Heroku, after you have cloned and bundled, run the following commands:

NB: These instructions are for the basic authentication strategy. 

    heroku create
    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:migrate
    heroku config:add REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY=<unique, private and long alphanumeric key, e.g. abcd1234edfg78910>
    heroku config:add REST_AUTH_DIGEST_STRETCHES<count of number of times to apply the digest, 10 recommended>
    heroku run console 

When inside the console, run the creating a new user step above. You should then be able to access your server and start using it.

## Display
Just open a browser on `/`. The page refreshes every 30 seconds with the latest
status fetched by the cron job or received via Webhook. That is,
refreshing the page doesn't cause the individual builds to be re-polled.

### Layout
The layout consists of a grid of tiles representing the projects.  The
number of projects that need to be displayed is determined automatically.

### Tile colors
Tiles are green for green projects, red for red projects, and light gray if the
project's build server cannot be reached. If the build server is online but no
builds have been run then the tile will appear in yellow. A pulsating tile indicates
that a new build is currently in progress.

### Build Statuses
To the right of the ticker and name, each project lists the amount of time
since the last build, followed by the build status history.  The last 5-8 builds
are displayed from left to right, in reverse chronological order -- the most
recent build will be on the left and the least recent on the right.
Successful builds are marked with a filled in circle, and unsuccessful builds
are marked with an x.

### Admin Interface
Click 'manage projects' at the lower right to edit project details.

## CI
CI for ProjectMonitor is [here](http://travis-ci.org/pivotal/projectmonitor), and it's aggregated at [ci.pivotallabs.com](http://ci.pivotallabs.com)
(that's an instance of ProjectMonitor, of course).

## Development
The public Tracker project for ProjectMonitor is [here](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/2872).

### Running tests
To run tests, run:

    rake setup
    rake spec

### Javascript tests
To run Jasmine tests, run this once when setting up the project or if you haven't consistently been running guard:

    rake jasmine:compile_coffeescript

To keep your jasmine tests current, run:

    guard

Install phantomjs if needed:

    brew install phantomjs

Then, to run Jasmine tests from the command line, run:

    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake spec:javascript

To run Jasmine tests from the browser, with a rails server running, visit [http://localhost:3000/specs](http://localhost:3000/specs)

See the [jasmine-rails](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-rails) documentation for more details.

### Development server
To run a local development server and worker, run:

    foreman start
